# Snake

## Program Description

This video game is a game that discusses the relationship between 
money and happiness. In this game, I used a snake to simulate the
life of a human and argue that people's happiness from money is 
relative to which life period they are in. Players use arrow keys 
to control the snake. In order to get higher money, players need 
to control the snake to eat money that randomly appeared on the map. 
As the money getting higher, the snake will grow longer, and different 
monologues will appear to express my idea.
