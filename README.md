#Snake

Program Description: This video game is a game that discuss the relationship
between money and happiness. In this game, I used a snake to simulate the 
life of a human and argue that people's happiness from money is relative 
to which life period they are in. Through this action, I want to 
inform my audiences, mostly white-collar office workers, to notice that 
their belief in money and happiness will change over time. As my audiences 
play my game, they can also experience the happiness from the game 
and realize that not only money can bring happiness to them.
